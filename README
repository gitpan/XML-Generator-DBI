XML::Generator::DBI
===================

This module allows you to generate SAX events (and thus XML) from
DBI database queries. It should be considered a replacement for
the outdated DBIx::XML_RDB, since it is better in many many ways.

INSTALLATION

Before installation, edit the file PWD in this directory. This contains
connection information to test against. It needs to work or the
tests will fail. Oh, you also need XML::Handler::YAWriter for the
second test file to be performed. But it will just pass if you don't
have it.

Then simply do the usual jiggery pokery:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
su
make install

And start plugging SAX stuff together.
