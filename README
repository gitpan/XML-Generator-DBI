XML::Generator::DBI
===================

This module allows you to generate SAX events (and thus XML) from
DBI database queries. It should be considered a replacement for
the outdated DBIx::XML_RDB, since it is better in many many ways.

INSTALLATION

In order to run the tests you need DBD::SQLite 0.27 installed, but
they will run cleanly without DBD::SQLite installed (it just won't
execute any SQL!).

Then simply do the usual jiggery pokery:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
su
make install

And start plugging SAX stuff together.
